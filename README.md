# Example Developers Journal

Welcome to the developers journal, this journal is where we define our purpose, mission and vision of the 
Appressa development team and our practices, we also define the products that we develop and the tools we use.

As with all things in software, things change over time, we want to keep this journal fluid and flexible so that we can keep every developer current and future informed of the development process.
